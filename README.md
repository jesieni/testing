# Automated tests writing practise

This repository documents my journey through learing how to use Selenium & [`selenium-webdriver`](https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/javascript/index.html), [chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) and [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) in creating tests scripts. Work in progress.
